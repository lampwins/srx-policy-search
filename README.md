# SRX Policy Search

**NOTE: This project is now considered deprecated and is not likely to see any future development. This was a first attempt at parsing and automating parts of Juniper SRX security policy. It is rather inefficient as it is all string manipulation and screen scraping. Fear not though, these efforts are being rolled into orangengine https://github.com/lampwins/orangengine**

This is a simple Python script that searches a Juniper SRX policy for references to a provided search term.
You can search policies by either IP address, service, or action.

####Setup
You will need to connect to a device and retrieve its configuration. Then you need a search object.
```
config = Configuration('192.168.1.1', 'username', 'password')
searcher = Search(config)
```
Now you can begin searching. All search methods return a list of `Policy` objects or an empty list is there
are no matches.

####IP Address
IP address searches can be either explicit or by default include
policies that reference containing subnets. You may also search by CIDR notation.
```
policies = searcher.search_by_ip('10.0.0.1')  # includes subnets like 10.0.0.0/8
policies = searcher.search_by_ip('192.168.0.0/24')  # CIDR - includes subnets
policies = searcher.search_by_ip('"172.16.1.1"')  # Explicit - assumes /32
policies = searcher.search_by_ip('"172.24.1.0/24"')  # Explicit CIDR
```
The `Policy` class has a `__str__` method so a simple two liner can print all your policies.


####Service
Service based searches ask for a destination protocol and port and currently only support UDP and TCP searches.
```
policies = searcher.search_by_service('tcp', '443')
```

####Action
Action based searches ask for one of the three standard SRX policy actions to match on.
```
policies = searcher.search_by_action('deny')  # permit, deny, and reject
```

####Further Use

The polices are normalized into a simple `Policy` data model which could be used to translate into another system.

Also included is a basic CLI in `main.py` which makes used of everything mentioned above.
```
[0] Exit/Quit
[1] IP
[2] Service
[3] Action
